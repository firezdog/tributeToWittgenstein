			<p><a target=_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</a> made fundamental contributions to 20th century philosophy in the philosophy of logic, language, mathematics, and many other areas, engaging with and extending the philosophies
				of great thinkers like <a target=_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> and <a target=_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege">Gottlob Frege</a>. But Wittgenstein was more than just an academic or scholar: he lived
				his philosophy, often with great suffering, striving for perfection in everything he did and holding steadfast to his principles and personal vision.</p>
			<p>Wittgenstein was born into one of the richest families in Austria, but refused his inheritance because he did not feel he deserved it. Upon entering Cambridge, he threw himself whole-heartedly into the study of logic under Bertrand Russell, sticking
				steadfastly to the problems he encountered until he was convinced of their solution. On the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered to go to the trenches out of a sense of duty; during his free time, he meditated about God and wrote what would
				become his most famous work, <a target=_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus"><em>The Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em></a>.</p>
			<p>After writing the <em>Tractatus</em>, convinced that the major problems of philosophy had been solved, he abandoned the discipline for forays into teaching, architecture, and gardening. His mind, however, could not rest -- philosophical questions were
				for him almost a torment, and he eventually returned to philosophy in order to devise a method of banishing them. In works like <em>The Blue Books</em> and <a target=_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations"><em>The Philosphical Investigations</em></a>				he showed how extensions of our everyday way of thinking about things lead us into philosophical dilemmas at once ridiculous and insoluble and tried to show how we can escape these dilemmas by carefully documenting what we do and say and vigilantly
				observing the context in which we do and say it. Only by limiting expressions to their proper sphere would we able to escape "the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language."</p>
			<p>Wittgenstein died on April 28, 1951. Throughout his life he felt that religion was something possible, a kind of model for life, but at the same time he could never bring himself to declare a definite religious faith or allegiance -- in part because
				he doubted whether such things could be legitimately expressed in language. Wittgenstein did not care about a final reward or a blessed hereafter -- for him, it was enough to have lived bravely and honestly. For all his torments, he was satisfied
				with the way he had lived. His last words, "Tell them I have had a wonderful life."</p>
